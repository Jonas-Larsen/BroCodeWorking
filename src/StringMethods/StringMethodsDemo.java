        //boolean result = name.equalsIgnoreCase("Jonas"); // this will return a boolean value, can be used in an if statement or anything else, it is case sensitive unless i use the equalsIgnoreCase method
        //int result = name.length(); // this will return the length of your name in the number of characters that are used in the variable "Name"
        //char result = name.charAt(0); // This returns the letter/character that is stored on the chosen index within the () after charAt
        //int result = name.indexOf("J"); // This will display the character you are searching for within the () after indexOf and display the position of the chosen value
        //boolean result = name.isEmpty(); //will return a boolean value telling you rather it is true or false that the variable chosen is empty or not
        //String result = name.toUpperCase(); // this will turn all of the characters to toUppercase you can also do the opposite with toLowerCase
        //String result = name.trim(); // this will remove all of the empty space that are either in front of or behind the word in your variable
        //String result = name.replace('o', 'u' ); // This will replace an existing character in your variable with another chosen character within the parentese (Old character "Already chosen in your variable, New character "The character you want instead of the old one)
        //System.out.println(result);
